Programming Project #4 for CSci 112.

CSCI 112: Programmin Project 4

Due Date: July 18th by 11:59 p.m.

You will create an Object with 3 fields. The name of the Object is up to you as well as the fields (this means the variables i.e.: name, date, whatever). It should have the normal methods associated with an object.

You will have a Work class. The work class will contain an ArrayList of your Objects (the class you made from above).

  Work methods should be but are not limited to:
    - A method to create your objects and add them to your ArrayList.
    - A method to display all the data of each object in the ArrayList.
    - A method to copy the data from the ArrayList to a binary file.
    - A method to read from the binary file to make a *new* ArrayList.
    
  Your Driver will:
    - Pass all the data needed for your Objects to the Work class.
    - Call the Works method to display all the data.
    - Call the Works method to copy to a binary file.
    - Call the Works method to read from the binary file.
    - Call the Works method to display all the data.
    
You pick a binary file name (it should end with .dat). The name of the file should be passed from the driver to Work.

Your program should contain all necessary exception handling.

*No late programs will be accepted. If your program does not compile, it will not receive any credit. If you need help, come see me during my office hours, make an appointment with me, or speak to a TA in the labs on Sunday - Thursday from 5:00 - 8:00 p.m.
